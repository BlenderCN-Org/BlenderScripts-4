# BlenderScripts
Some little scripts needed to work faster, often oriented 3D realtime workflow.

## How to use
Until I figure how to create UI, just open .py on the text editor panel and press alt + P

## renameImage
Rename all image data-block using filename.

## switchUV
Easily switch active UV panel of selected objects. Useful when you set viewport shading to *Material* or *Texture*, or with Baketool plugin when adding objects to lightmap baking.
