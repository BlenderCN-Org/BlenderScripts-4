# BlenderScripts
Some little scripts needed to work faster, often oriented 3D realtime workflow.

## How to use
Until I figure how to create addon setup, just open nothing-is-3D-tools.py on the text editor panel and press alt + P

## Description

* easily switch active UV channel of selected objects. (useful when you set viewport shading to *Material* or *Texture*, or with Baketool plugin when adding objects to lightmap baking)
* rename UV channels as UVMap & UV2 (useful when meshes imported from other 3d software)
